<h2> Dear Reader</h2>

<h3>Here's why you should consider building your own website:</h3>

<h3>Note to Samuel:</h3>
<p>This whole website was built with only html and no CSS(which is used for style much better than Wordpress) or  Javasript (which gives unmatched funcinality... thats how you make REAL fun websites) As I come back to this it will become even better as I learn now take a look at my resume.</p> <br>
